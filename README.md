# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-the-Effects-of-U.S.-Political-Leanings-on-the-Number-of-Covid-19-Cases
Our research explores whether a particular US regionâ€™s overall political affiliation affects their total number of Covid-19 cases, exploring additional factors such as education ranking and Covid-19 safety guidelines. Using linear regression and multiple linear regression, we explored the relationship between these variables and found that there is a correlation between the political leaning and the safety policies of a US region and its overall amount of Covid cases.
